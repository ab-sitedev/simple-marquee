# Simple Marquee
A stupid-basic browser-based marquee app.

### What Inspired This?
I run the A/V ministry at my local church and too often the preacher forgets to unmute his wireless microphone. This app replaces my frantic arm-waving with a simple click of a button.

### How to use
1. Click "Open Display Window", make it full-screen on an external monitor facing the person(s) you want to signal to.
2. Click "Submit" on the config page.
